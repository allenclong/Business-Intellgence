The Business Intelligence Front-End
===================================

Utopia: Self-Service BI
------------------------
The vision is that if users have easy-to-use BI tools, they can service themselves, asking tough business questions that yield th most value, without any assistance from IT.  There would be no more backlog of IT requests and users could act at the face pace of business demands. It's a nice vision, but not completely realistic.
